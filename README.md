# Geodynamics and Data Mining for Earthquake Hazards

### Introduction
A key piece of data in assessing seismic hazard for a region is the knowledge of
prior activity – the magnitude, frequency, as well as damage patterns of likely
earthquakes. Prior to the digital error of modern seismology and the
pervasiveness of social media, knowledge of patterns of damage came from
historical accounts, or more recently in the 1900’s, after event surveys. These
accounts are important in calibrating current strong ground motion numerical
models for large earthquakes that could cause widespread destruction. See the
project proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jy4wVc0VI-S1xsQBLGDiCbZen5ulVX0YXdsRfj8YVVM/edit).

### Problem Statement
The data collected through felt reports provides insight into the effects of earthquakes overtime but is hard to use in research due to how it is currently formatted in various scanned forms. The felt reports date back for many more years than digital or instrumental records allowing the timescale of data used in research to be lengthened. Various people surveyed with felt reports will also have different mannerisms and qualitative measurements used in their language. Some respondents provide extraneous information that will need to be removed to make their response useful. 

### Proposed Solution
The goal of this project is to capture all information for researchers studying
the damage extent of historical earthquake studies. We will scrape data from the postcard images
and convert to text. Then we will process the text felt reports with NLP to try and
extract research usable data from them.
